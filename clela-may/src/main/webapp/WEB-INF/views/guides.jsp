		<div class="panel">
  			<p> Carnation Care<br>
				Dianthus are fairly easy to grow and care for. Dianthus carophyllus does best in USDA hardiness Zones 7 to 10, so it is not quite as cold hardy as other dianthus varieties. Although dianthus are sometimes known as a short-lived perennial, if they have the right conditions, you can expect years of beauty and fragrance from them. 
				They're a beautiful choice for the cottage garden with their vibrant colors and easy seasonal care. Deadheading them after first bloom helps insure re-blooming later in the season. They do best without mulch, but if you do mulch use a natural mulch instead of dyed mulches. Carnations, like all dianthus, are deer resistant, but rabbits may enjoy nibbling on the leaves. 
				<br><br>
				Light<br>
				Although they do best in full sun, carnations are fine with some partial shade. Too much bright afternoon sun might cause the petals of brightly colored carnations to fade. Plant your carnations where they'll get morning sun rather than afternoon sun, if possible, to keep the flowers looking fresh and the colors bright.
				<br><br>
				Temperature and Humidity<br>
				Carnations like a warm environment, but will wilt in extreme heat. They do best in low humidity. However, an occasional light spritz of cool water during very hot weather may help cool them down a bit.

		<button class="accordion">Scabiosas</button>
		<div class="panel">
  			<p> Scabiosa Care<br>
				The family Caprifoliaceae contains the genus Scabiosa, as well as other ornamental flowers such as honeysuckle and weigela. Scabiosa flowers earned the nickname pincushion flower thanks to their prominent stamens that emerge from the compact, round blooms like pins in a pincushion. Scabiosa plants form a low mound of foliage, and healthy plants may produce 20 to 50 blooms, each held individually on thin stems.
				All things considered, scabiosa plants are exceedingly easy to care for, as long as you provide them with enough light and well-draining soil. In ideal growing conditions, your scabiosa plants will act as short-lived hardy perennials in USDA hardiness zones five through nine—they'll bloom from spring until frost, with the heaviest blooming period occurring in May. Keep the flowers deadheaded for the best chance at repeat blooming. Deadheading is laborious on plants that have so many small flowers on individual stems, so you can shear the plant in midsummer when the blossom output is low to encourage a new flush of blooms in early fall.
				<br><br>
				Light<br>
				Plant your scabiosa in a spot that plenty of sunlight each day, at least six to eight hours' worth. Typically, this means a location that boasts full sun, but some partial afternoon shade is fine too, especially if you're growing the blooms in a particularly hot summer climate. They will not do well when planted in a shady spot, and you will notice a reduction in blooms and buds if the plant isn't getting enough light. 
				<br><br>
				Temperature and Humidity<br>
				Scabiosa blooms do best in the moderate temperatures that spring to early summer and early fall offer. They dislike being hot or humid but can handle the weather of peak summer better if in a spot that is partially shady. Ultimately, if planted in the proper USDA hardiness zones, your scabiosa should have no problem growing well.

		<button class="accordion">Snap Dragons</button>
		<div class="panel">
  			<p> Snapdragon Care<br>
				Snapdragons are rather slow-growing when planted from seeds, so they are normally planted from purchased nursery seedlings, which are widely sold in economical six-packs. They can also be grown fairly easily from seeds started indoors weeks before the last winter frost.
				Snapdragons do best in rich, well-draining soil in a sunny location, though they will tolerate part shade. Pinching off the stem tips on young plants will make them thicker and bushier, and deadheading the spent flowers will extend the bloom season, often right into the first frost of the late fall or early winter. Snapdragons can repeat bloom throughout the season but they do best in the cool of spring and fall. In cooler climates, they bloom all summer long, and in milder climates, they sometimes bloom throughout the winter.
				These short-lived perennials are usually grown as annuals. Even when they do overwinter, snapdragons never seem to bloom as robustly as they did in their first year. However, they should form seed pods in the first year; if you are lucky, they may even self-sow in the garden. 
  			 	<br><br>
  			 	Light<br>
				Your snapdragons will bloom most profusely in full sun to partial shade. Once the temperature heats up, they may stop blooming altogether. Planting them in part shade and keeping them well watered will help them make it through the summer and they will likely bloom again in fall. 
				<br><br>
				Temperature and Humidity<br>
				Snapdragons are tender perennials that are hardy in USDA zones 7 to 11. But snapdragons prefer cooler temperatures and are at their best when nighttime temperatures are in the low 40s and daytime temperatures in the low 70s Fahrenheit. For this reason, they are usually grown as annuals to provide garden color in the cooler months of spring and fall.
				Once established in the bed and hardened off, snapdragons can withstand sub-freezing temperatures. If you make sure they stay well-watered during cold spells and add a layer of pine straw mulch, they can last for quite some time and will survive quite low temperatures until the chill has passed.
				Seedlings grown indoors need to be hardened off for about 10 days to two weeks before planting in the garden.

	 	<button class="accordion">Sun Flowers</button>
		<div class="panel">
  			<p> Sunflower Care<br>
				About the only mandatory requirements for growing sunflowers are a sunny location and well-drained soil. If possible, select a location that is sheltered from strong winds that might topple these towering plants. It can be helpful to plant sunflowers in groups, so they can support each other against wind and rain. Growers often have to stake their sunflowers, especially the tall varieties, to keep them growing upright. The plants can get very top-heavy when in bloom. Planting sunflowers along a fence is the easiest way to stake them. Bamboo stakes are also strong enough to keep them upright. Use care when inserting the stakes, so you don't damage the plant's roots.
				Sunflowers don't like to compete with weeds, so keep the garden clean. Mulching around your sunflowers will help with both maintaining soil moisture and weed suppression. Furthermore, wildlife is often attracted to sunflower seedlings. So it's best to protect seedlings with row covers or screening, removing the cover once the plants are 1 to 2 feet tall.
				<br><br>
				Light<br>
				For the best flowering and sturdiest stems, plant your sunflowers in full sun, meaning at least six hours of direct sunlight on most days. Because they are heliotropic (their flower heads follow the sun), ample sun exposure will help them remain straight rather than bending toward the direction where the light is predominant.
				<br><br>
				Temperature and Humidity<br>
				Optimal temperatures for growing sunflowers are between 70 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit. But they are tolerant to high heat as long as their moisture needs are met. And they can handle somewhat chilly but sunny environments. Plus, they’re tolerant to high humidity, but they must have well-draining soil and good air circulation to prevent root rot and other disease.

		<button class="accordion">Verbenas</button>
		<div class="panel">
  			<p> How to Grow Verbena<br>
				Hybrid annual verbenas are best grown in relatively dry soil in a sunny location. There is very little care necessary, other than regular watering.
				These plants are susceptible to powdery mildew, and they may be visited by common insect pests that can be treated with insecticidal soaps or chemical sprays. Such problems are rarely fatal to the plants, however.
				<br><br>
				Light<br>
				Plant verbena in full sun. Flowering will be much reduced in shady locations. This is a plant that requires 8 to 10 hours of sun daily.
				<br><br>
				Temperature and Humidity<br>
				Planted as annuals hybrid verbenas perform suitably in virtually any climate, but may decline in the hottest period of the summer.

		<button class="accordion">Zinnias</button>
		<div class="panel">
  			<p> Zinnia Care<br>
				Zinnias are one of the few plants that are true annuals. Many plants labeled as annuals are actually perennials that are only hardy in the warmest hardiness zones, but zinnias will be annuals everywhere. There are spreading and dwarf zinnias that only grow about 6-8 inches tall, and the classic zinnia elegans can reach 4 feet tall.
				Zinnia plants can take a few weeks to become established, but once it warms up, expect them to bloom from late spring right through fall. The vibrant, tropical colors of zinnias work well in a hot border, picking up the hues of other reds and oranges. They are also nice for adding dramatic color to a container.
				The tall zinnia elegans is still a favorite for the back of the border, but new varieties, like the Thumbelina series, grow only about 6-inches tall and make great choices as edging plants or in containers.
				<br><br>
				Light<br>
				You really want to plant zinnias in a spot with full sun. You will get the most prolific blooms in a sunny spot and it will help to keep the leaves dry and thwart powdery mildew before it starts.
				<br><br>
				Temperature and Humidity<br>
				It doesn't matter how hot the summer gets; zinnia plants just keep on blooming.
